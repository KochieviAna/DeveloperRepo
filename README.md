# Course Overview

The TBC x USAID iOS Development Course was a 5-month program designed to simulate a professional environment for aspiring iOS developers like me. I engage in practical assignments to develop skills in Swift programming, UI/UX design, and app development. 

# Repository Structure

Each assignment is completed by me and is organized into its respective folder, named accordingly (e.g., Assignment7, Assignment8, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find the project files and resources related to that specific assignment.
